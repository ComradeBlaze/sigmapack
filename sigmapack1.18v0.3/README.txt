Hi! This is SigmaPack, the crappiest texture pack known to man. 

I'm sigma_turbine, and I made this godawful piece of crap. I would say I'm proud of it but my ego would be hurt at such an accusation.

Despite its crappiness in certain aspects I wanted it to be somewhat usable as an actual pack. 

Anyways, thanks for downloading this thing. Check the credits file for credits (isn't that nice?) and hope you enjoy it somehow.
