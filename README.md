# Hi, this is sigmapack.

### Created by sigma_turbine.

It's awful. Don't have high expectations.

You may need to extract the pack to get it to work. Language should be set to English (US) for funny item names.

If you have any questions, complaints, or compliments you can contact me on Discord at @ComradeBlaze#5995.

Thanks for checking it out.


## But sigma, the fuck is this thing? Is this a virus? Will it kill me?


Boy, I sure hope so! It won't, although it may emotionally hurt.

This pack mostly modifies mob, item, and gui textures as well as some sound files.

I won't post any previews becuase it's better to experience it for yourself.
