Hi! This is SigmaPack, the crappiest texture pack known to man. 

I'm sigma_turbine, and I made this godawful piece of crap. I would say I'm proud of it but my ego would be hurt at such an accusation.

Some texture changes were made to fit me (and only me) so I included some alternative files in the GUI section; simply swap them out as needed.

Hope you enjoy it somewhat.
