**Hi, this is sigmapack™️. Created by sigma_turbine.**
============================================

It's awful. Don't have high expectations.

You may need to extract the pack to get it to work. 

If you have any questions, complaints, or compliments you can contact me on Discord at @ComradeBlaze#9807

Thanks for checking it out.


**But sigma, what the fuck is this thing? Is this a virus? Will it kill me?**
============================================

Boy, I sure hope so! (It won't, although it may hurt.)

This pack mostly modifies mob, item, and gui textures as well as sound files.

I won't post any previews becuase it's funnier to experience it for yourself.

(Also cause I'm a lazy mf and don't have any compelation pictures of everything changed.)


**VERSIONS AVAILABLE:**
============================================

1.16v0.2 - First public release 

1.17v0.2 - Updated for 1.17, new tweaks added
